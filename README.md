### Project Title

**Image Classifier**

### Description

This project develops a library `classifier`, that someone can use in thier image classification model development.
The Library is a Python package that simplifies the process of building and training neural networks using PyTorch.
It includes functions to:
- Create a classifier model base on the user selected model architecture.
- Re-build the model from a checkpoint for inference or more training.

### Dependencies

This library requires the following Python packages:

- `torch`: Pytorch library for deep learning.
- `torchvision`: Vision utilities for Pytorch.

### Files used
`classifier.py`

### Usage

To use the library `classifier.py` in your project, download it to project workspace and import in your project files using:
```python
import classifier
```
